- are render packets a location type?

- model contains render packets (and animation data)
     - is model a good name
     - what about non-mesh locations e.g. volumetric point clouds
     - billboards
     - sprites (animated as well)

- animation data contains skeletons and clips?
    - but then how do skeletons relate to meshes

- light asset type??

- camera asset type???

- how do assets that modify other assets work?
    - i.e. skeleton with a clip that modifies a mesh

- how does instancing work? Is it an asset or just part of the rendering engine

- use a generic keyframe animation system
